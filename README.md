# Breast Cancer Classification Using PCA and Logistic Regression

1. Introduction
	- This milestone assignment provide analysis on dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classify breast cancer data using Logistic Regression.
 	- sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer was used which contains features of malignant and benign tumors such as
  		- Analyze the breast cancer dataset.
    		- Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA.
      		- Optimize logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning.
        	- Compare classification performance with and without PCA.
         	- Visualize results including PCA components, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

2. Library Requirements
	Below library was imported for this analysis which are
	- Python 3.7+
	- Libraries:
 		- numpy
  		- pandas
  		- matplotlib
  		- seaborn
  		- scikit-learn

3. Code Overview

	3.1 Load and Explore the Dataset
	- Load the `breast_cancer` dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
	- Analyzed basic statistics and visualize feature correlations.

	3.2 Data Preprocessing
	- Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
	- Visualize pairwise feature correlations with heatmap.

	3.3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	- PCA was used to reduce dimensions while retaining 95% variance.
	- Visualize cumulative explained variance.
	- created scatter plot the first two PCA components to show class separation.

	3.4 Logistic Regression
	- Hyperparameter tuning was done using `GridSearchCV`.
	- Train the optimized logistic regression model on PCA-reduced data.
	- Evaluate model performance with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
	- Compare results with models trained on original features.

	3.5 Visualizations
	- Explaination of variance plot for PCA.
	- Feature contributions to principal components.
	- Confusion matrix.
	- ROC curve.

4. Results
	Key results obtained:
	- Optimal PCA Components: Determined dynamically based on 95% variance threshold.
	- Determine the accuracy on PCA-Reduced Features: ~97%
	- Accuracy on Original Features: ~98%
	- Cross-Validation Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores: High scores demonstrating robust model performance.
	- ROC AUC: Area under the ROC curve ~0.99.

5. How to Run
	1. Clone or download the script via: https://github.com/AmazingTaiwo/BAN6420_M5_1.git
 	2. change the cmd directiry to the download path where the repository was clonned to
	3. Run the script in a Python environment on CMD via below command;
		- python_ban6420_m5_main2.py
  	4. Review outputs and visualizations in the terminal and pop-up generated plots as described in step 6.

6. Visualizations
    - 6.1 PCA Components Scatter Plot
    	- Illustration of separation between malignant and benign classes using the first two principal components.
    - 6.2 Cumulative Explained Variance
    	- Helps identify the optimal number of PCA components.
    - 6.3 Confusion Matrix
    	- A heatmap showing true vs. predicted classifications.
    - 6.4 ROC Curve
    	- Visualizes the modelâ€™s performance across various classification thresholds.
